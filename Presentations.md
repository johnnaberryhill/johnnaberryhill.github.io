Although I used to be very nervous giving presentations, my mentor (Dr. Sudeepa Bhattacharyya) taught me the importance of being able to share research with others. I have attended many local and national conferences, which has increased my confidence and public speaking skills.   

  
  Each conference has a different audience, whether that be other statisticians and bioinformaticians, computer scientists, biologists, physicians, social workers, and more. Because of this, I have learned how to share my results in a way that anyone could understand. Data specialists often find themselves working in an interdisciplinary team, so this is an important skill to have.
