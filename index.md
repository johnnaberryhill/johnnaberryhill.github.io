#### Welcome!
I am a statistican by background and data scientist by training. 

I expect to complete by masters degree in Statistics in May 2025. I am currently open for PhD roles in the field of biomedical informatics. I am particularly open to projects related to social/behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH). I am interested in using big data (such as EHR) to study the relationships between particular demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, and behavorial factors and health outcomes. I am also open to roles in spatial machine learning. I have lived in Arkansas my whole life, but I am open to relocating (please help me escape Arkansas!). 

Please navigate this site to learn more about me, my education, and my projects!
