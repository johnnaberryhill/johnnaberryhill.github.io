        I am a statistician by background and a data scientist by training.

        I expect to complete my master's degree in Statistics in May 2025.

        My research interests include:
        - Exploring the relationships between demographic, socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral factors and health outcomes
        - Uncovering health disparities and identifying at-risk populations
        - Utilizing Big Data, such as electronic health records (EHR)
        - Developing interpretable machine learning algorithms
        - Implementing spatial modeling and spatial machine learning

        I am currently seeking PhD positions in the areas mentioned above. I aspire to join a dry lab that uses cutting-edge techniques to analyze big data related to public health.

        Although I have no formal biology background, I am eager to learn how to incorporate genomic, biomarker, and other biological data into my analyses.
