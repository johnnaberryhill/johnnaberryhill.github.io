Throughout my time as a research assistant at Arkansas State University under Dr. Sudeepa Bhattacharyya and at the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research (NCTR) under Dr. Wen Zou, I have actively participated in several research projects. Below I will give an overview of a few select studies and my role in them.  
<br>

My projects have varied in aims and methods, but they all share a common goal: utilizing human health records to uncover patterns in predictors and outcomes.
